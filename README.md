The Knight in the Tiger's Skin is the most iconic Georgian medieval epic poem.

And even after decades it is still well-known for new generations. Nowadays children still reading and teaching this poem in school.

The book gets more and more interesting as you read on, starting in a rather not so obvious melancholy. But once you get to know the style of euology, it becomes interesting. Enjoyed reading it.
